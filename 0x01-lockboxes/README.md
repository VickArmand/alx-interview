## Lockboxes
<h4>Must Know</h4>

<p>For this project, you will need a solid understanding of several key concepts in order to develop a solution that can efficiently determine if all boxes can be opened. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be instrumental in tackling this project:</p>

<h4>Concepts Needed</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<h6>Lists and List Manipulation:</h6>
<ul><li>
Understanding how to work with lists, including accessing elements, iterating over lists, and modifying lists dynamically.
</li></ul></li>
<li>
<h6>Graph Theory Basics:</h6>
<ul><li>
Although not explicitly required, knowledge of graph theory (especially concepts related to traversal algorithms like Depth-First Search or Breadth-First Search) can be very helpful in solving this problem, as the boxes and keys can be thought of as nodes and edges in a graph.</li>
<li>Graph Theory (Khan Academy)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<h6>Algorithmic Complexity:</h6>
<ul><li>
Understanding the time and space complexity of your solution is important, as it can help in writing more efficient algorithms.</li>
<li>Big O Notation (GeeksforGeeks)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
<h6>Recursion:</h6>
<ul><li>
Some solutions might require a recursive approach to traverse through the boxes and keys.</li>
<li>Recursion in Python (Real Python)</li></ul></li>
<li>
<h6>Queue and Stack:</h6>
<ul><li>
Knowing how to use queues and stacks is crucial if implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to traverse through the keys and boxes.</li>
<li>Python Queue and Stack (GeeksforGeeks)
</li></ul></li>
<li>
<h6>Set Operations:</h6>
<ul><li>
Understanding how to use sets for keeping track of visited boxes and available keys can optimize the search process.</li>
<li>Python Sets (Python Official Documentation)
</li>
</ul></li>
<li>
</ol>
<p>By reviewing these concepts and utilizing these resources, you will be well-equipped to develop an efficient solution for this project, applying both your algorithmic thinking and Python programming skills.</p>
