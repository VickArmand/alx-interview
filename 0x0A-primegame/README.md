## Prime Game

<p>For this project, you will need to leverage your understanding of prime numbers, game theory, and algorithm optimization to solve a competitive game scenario. The challenge involves determining the winner of a game based on the strategic removal of prime numbers and their multiples from a set of consecutive integers.</p>

#### Concepts Needed:
<ol>
<li>

#### Prime Numbers:
<ul><li>
Understanding what prime numbers are.</li>
<li>Efficient algorithms for identifying prime numbers within a range.</li></ul></li>
<li>

#### Sieve of Eratosthenes:
<ul><li>
An efficient algorithm for finding all prime numbers up to any given limit, which can be particularly useful for this task.</li></ul></li>
<li>

#### Game Theory:
<ul><li>
Basic principles of competitive games where players take turns and the concept of optimal play.</li><li>
Understanding win conditions and strategies that lead to a win or loss.</li></ul></li>
<li>

#### Dynamic Programming/Memoization:
<ul><li>
Using previous results to make future calculations faster, potentially necessary for optimizing the solution for multiple rounds of the game.</li></ul></li>
<li>

#### Python Programming:
<ul><li>
Loops and conditional statements for implementing game logic and algorithms.</li><li>
Arrays and lists for storing the integers and tracking removed numbers.</li></ul></li>
