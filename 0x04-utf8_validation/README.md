## UTF-8 Validation

<h4>Learning Objectives</h4>
<p>For the this project, you will need to apply your knowledge in bitwise operations, understanding of the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills to validate whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. Hereâ€™s a list of concepts and resources that will be helpful:</p>

<h5>Concepts Needed:</h5>
<ol>
<li>
<h6>Bitwise Operations in Python:</h6>
<ul>
<li>
Understanding how to manipulate bits in Python, including operations like AND (&), OR (|), XOR (^), NOT (~), shifts (<<, >>).
</li></ul></li>
<li>
<h6>UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:</h6>
<ul>
<li>
Familiarity with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.</li><li>
Understanding the patterns that represent a valid UTF-8 encoded character.</li><li>
UTF-8 Wikipedia</li><li>
Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle</li><li>
The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets</li></ul></li>
<li>
<h6>Data Representation:</h6>
<ul>
<li>
How to represent and work with data at the byte level.</li><li>
Handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.</li></ul></li>
<li>
<h6>List Manipulation in Python:</h6>
<ul>
<li>
Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.
</li></ul></li>
<li>
<h6>Boolean Logic:</h6>
